   As you can see, the original source of your fork is indicated. You can also find information about how your fork compares to the original a little further down the page:

## Pulling changes from the upstream repository

If the original repository that you forked (the "upstream" repository) changes, you will be able to merge those changes into your own:

1) Open your fork in GitHub.


2) Confirm that there are changes to pull by clicking the compare link:

3) **CAREFULL!** This will lead you to the upstream repository. To get back to your own repository, click the "switching the base" link:

4)  You are in the right place if the small merge direction arrow points from the upstream repository to your own:

5) Transfering changes from one repository to another (related) one always requires the use od a pull request. Usually, a pull request is made to ask the maintainer of the upstream repository to incorporate changes that were made in a fork. But in this case, we are moving changes in the other direction. Yet, we are still going to use a pull request. Do that by clicking on the "Create pull request" button:
